# Gamified timer

Pomodoro timer for deep-work sessions with some gaming elements to bring more fun, motivation, and encourage you to take healthy breaks between work sessions. [Interact with the live project here](https://gamified-timer-douglasf.vercel.app).

How it works:

- Start a 25-min timer and focus on important work
- When the time is up, you are given a challenge (like go for a 3-min walk, stretch your legs, or exercise your eyes) to be completed during your break
- If you complete the challenge, you earn experience (XP) points, and with enough of it you can advance to the next level

Implemented features:

- Countdown timer
- Stats and progress bar
- Notifications via web browser (with sound)
- Responsiveness
- Scroll-to-section on mobile
